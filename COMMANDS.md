# ðŸŽ¯ AI Project Manager - Command Quick Reference

## Getting Started - New Users

**First time using AI Project Manager?** Try these commands in order:

```
1. /status    - See what state your project is in
2. /help      - Learn all available commands  
3. /init      - Set up AI project management
4. /resume    - Start working on your project
```

## Essential Commands

### Discovery Commands
- **`/status`** - Get current project state and suggested next steps
- **`/help`** - Show all commands with detailed descriptions
- **`/analyze`** - Full project analysis and theme discovery

### Setup Commands  
- **`/init`** - Initialize AI project management (auto-selects best option)
- **`/config`** - View current configuration settings

### Work Commands
- **`/resume`** - Resume previous work and active tasks
- **`/tasks`** - Show active tasks and progress
- **`/newTask <description>`** - Create and start working on new task

### Project Understanding
- **`/themes`** - Show project themes and file organization
- **`/flows`** - Show user experience flows and journeys

### Advanced Workflow
- **`/branch`** - Create AI work branch for parallel development
- **`/merge`** - Merge completed AI work back to main

## How Commands Work

### Workflow-Level Approval
When you use a command like `/init`, you're giving **workflow-level approval**. This means:

âœ… **AI can chain multiple tools automatically**  
âœ… **AI makes decisions based on your project data**  
âœ… **AI executes complex multi-step processes**  
âœ… **AI operates autonomously within the approved scope**

### Example Workflows

**Getting Started:**
```
User: "/status"
AI: Analyzes project â†’ Shows current state â†’ Suggests next commands

User: "/init"  
AI: Analyzes project â†’ Presents options â†’ Executes initialization â†’ Sets up structure
```

**Daily Development:**
```
User: "/resume"
AI: Loads context â†’ Finds active tasks â†’ Continues where you left off

User: "/tasks"
AI: Shows active work â†’ Progress status â†’ Next steps
```

**Project Analysis:**
```
User: "/analyze"
AI: Discovers themes â†’ Maps project structure â†’ Shows organization

User: "/themes"
AI: Shows discovered themes â†’ File mappings â†’ Relationships
```

## Technical Details

### Command vs MCP Tools
- **Commands** (`/status`, `/init`, etc.) - High-level workflows with single approval
- **MCP Tools** (`get_project_state_analysis`, etc.) - Individual operations with separate approvals

### Available MCP Tools
The AI Project Manager provides 62+ MCP tools that commands use behind the scenes:
- Project management tools (initialize, status, blueprints)
- Task management tools (create, update, list, sidequests)  
- Context loading tools (themes, flows, escalation)
- File operations tools (read, analyze, cross-reference)
- Branch management tools (create, switch, merge, status)
- Session management tools (boot, persistence, restoration)
- Database tools (queries, analytics, optimization)

### Getting Help
- **`/help`** - Overview of all commands
- **`help_commands`** tool - Detailed help system
- **`help_commands` with specific command** - Detailed help for individual commands

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happened when I said 'continue development'"
**Solution**: Use `/status` or `/resume` commands instead of natural language.

### "I don't know what state my project is in"
**Solution**: Use `/status` to get current state analysis and suggested next steps.

### "The AI isn't doing anything automatically"
**Solution**: Commands provide workflow approval. Use `/init` for initial setup, `/resume` for ongoing work.

### "I want to see all available options"
**Solution**: Use `/help` for command overview, or `help_commands` tool for detailed information.
