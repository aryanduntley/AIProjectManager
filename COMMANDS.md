## How Commands Work

### Workflow-Level Approval
When you use a command like `/aipm-init`, you're giving **workflow-level approval**. This means:

âœ… **AI can chain multiple tools automatically**  
âœ… **AI makes decisions based on your project data**  
âœ… **AI executes complex multi-step processes**  
âœ… **AI operates autonomously within the approved scope**

### Example Workflows

**Getting Started:**
```
User: "/aipm-status"
AI: Analyzes project â†’ Shows current state â†’ Suggests next commands

```

**Daily Development:**
```
User: "/aipm-resume"
AI: Loads context â†’ Finds active tasks â†’ Continues where you left off

User: "/aipm-tasks"
AI: Shows active work â†’ Progress status â†’ Next steps

User: "/aipm-pause"
AI: Finds stopping point â†’ Saves all progress â†’ Prepares for clean resumption
```

**Project Analysis:**
```
User: "/aipm-analyze"
AI: Discovers themes â†’ Maps project structure â†’ Shows organization

User: "/aipm-themes"
AI: Shows discovered themes â†’ File mappings â†’ Relationships
```

**AI Development & Deployment:**
```
User: "/aipm-branch"
AI: Creates work branch â†’ Switches to it â†’ Ready for AI development

User: "/aipm-merge" 
AI: Merges work branch â†’ Back to ai-pm-org-main â†’ Creates PR if possible

User: "/aipm-deploy"

```
User: "/aipm-setup-remote"
AI: Creates ai-pm-org-main â†’ Sets up team structure â†’ Pushes to remote

User: "/aipm-clone-team" 
AI: Clones remote AI state â†’ Sets up local collaboration â†’ Ready to work

User: "/aipm-sync"
AI: Fetches remote updates â†’ Merges changes â†’ Keeps AI state current
```

## Technical Details

### Command vs MCP Tools
- **Commands** (`/status`, `/init`, etc.) - High-level workflows with single approval
- **MCP Tools** (`get_project_state_analysis`, etc.) - Individual operations with separate approvals

### Available MCP Tools
The AI Project Manager provides 65+ MCP tools that commands use behind the scenes:
- Project management tools (initialize, status, blueprints)
- Task management tools (create, update, list, sidequests)  
- Context loading tools (themes, flows, escalation)
- File operations tools (read, analyze, cross-reference)
- Branch management tools (create, switch, merge, status)
- Session management tools (boot, persistence, restoration)
- Database tools (queries, analytics, optimization, backup, maintenance)

### Getting Help
- **`/help`** - Overview of all commands
- **`help_commands`** tool - Detailed help system
- **`help_commands` with specific command** - Detailed help for individual commands

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happened when I said 'continue development'"
**Solution**: Use `/aipm-status` or `/aipm-resume` commands instead of natural language.

### "I don't know what state my project is in"
**Solution**: Use `/aipm-status` to get current state analysis and suggested next steps.

### "The AI isn't doing anything automatically"
**Solution**: Commands provide workflow approval. Use `/aipm-init` for initial setup, `/aipm-resume` for ongoing work.

### "I want to see all available options"
**Solution**: Use `/aipm-help` for command overview, or `help_commands` tool for detailed information.
