# ðŸŽ¯ AI Project Manager - Command Quick Reference

## Getting Started - New Users

**First time using AI Project Manager?** Try these commands in order:

```
1. run-aipm-status    - See what state your project is in
2. run-aipm-help      - Learn all available commands  
3. run-aipm-init      - Set up AI project management
4. run-aipm-resume    - Start working on your project
```

> **Note**: Due to Claude Code UI limitations with custom slash commands, all commands now use the `run-` prefix instead of `/`. Simply type the command naturally (e.g., "run-aipm-init") and the AI will execute it automatically.

## Essential Commands

### Discovery Commands
- **`run-aipm-status`** - Get current project state and suggested next steps
- **`run-aipm-help`** - Show all commands with detailed descriptions
- **`run-aipm-analyze`** - Full project analysis and theme discovery

### Setup Commands  
- **`run-aipm-init`** - Initialize AI project management (auto-selects best option)
- **`run-aipm-config`** - View current configuration settings

### Work Commands
- **`run-aipm-resume`** - Resume previous work and active tasks
- **`run-aipm-tasks`** - Show active tasks and progress
- **`run-aipm-newTask`** - Create and start working on new task
- **`run-aipm-pause`** - Find suitable stopping point and prepare for clean resumption

### Project Understanding
- **`run-aipm-themes`** - Show project themes and file organization
- **`run-aipm-flows`** - Show user experience flows and journeys

### Advanced Workflow
- **`run-aipm-branch`** - Create AI work branch for parallel development
- **`run-aipm-merge`** - Merge completed AI branch work back to ai-pm-org-main
- **`run-aipm-deploy`** - Deploy AI improvements to your main branch (ai-pm-org-main â†’ user's main)

### Database Management
- **`run-aipm-backup`** - Create manual database backup with timestamp
- **`run-aipm-maintenance`** - Run database cleanup, archiving, and optimization
- **`run-aipm-db-stats`** - Show database health and storage statistics

### ðŸ¤– AI-Handled Git Operations
The AI automatically handles complex git operations when needed. You can simply **request git actions in natural language**:

- *"Push the AI organizational changes to remote"*
- *"Pull the latest AI changes from the team"*  
- *"Set up remote collaboration for this project"*
- *"Sync with the remote AI branch"*
- *"Check if there are remote updates"*

The AI will automatically use the appropriate MCP tools for git operations behind the scenes.

## How Commands Work

### Workflow-Level Approval
When you use a command like `/aipm-init`, you're giving **workflow-level approval**. This means:

âœ… **AI can chain multiple tools automatically**  
âœ… **AI makes decisions based on your project data**  
âœ… **AI executes complex multi-step processes**  
âœ… **AI operates autonomously within the approved scope**

### Example Workflows

**Getting Started:**
```
User: "/aipm-status"
AI: Analyzes project â†’ Shows current state â†’ Suggests next commands

User: "/aipm-init"  
AI: Analyzes project â†’ Presents options â†’ Executes initialization â†’ Sets up structure
```

**Daily Development:**
```
User: "/aipm-resume"
AI: Loads context â†’ Finds active tasks â†’ Continues where you left off

User: "/aipm-tasks"
AI: Shows active work â†’ Progress status â†’ Next steps

User: "/aipm-pause"
AI: Finds stopping point â†’ Saves all progress â†’ Prepares for clean resumption
```

**Project Analysis:**
```
User: "/aipm-analyze"
AI: Discovers themes â†’ Maps project structure â†’ Shows organization

User: "/aipm-themes"
AI: Shows discovered themes â†’ File mappings â†’ Relationships
```

**AI Development & Deployment:**
```
User: "/aipm-branch"
AI: Creates work branch â†’ Switches to it â†’ Ready for AI development

User: "/aipm-merge" 
AI: Merges work branch â†’ Back to ai-pm-org-main â†’ Creates PR if possible

User: "/aipm-deploy"
AI: Merges ai-pm-org-main â†’ User's main â†’ Creates backup â†’ AI improvements deployed!
```

**Team Collaboration (AI-Handled):**
```
User: "Set up remote collaboration for this project"
AI: Creates ai-pm-org-main â†’ Sets up team structure â†’ Pushes to remote

User: "Pull the latest team changes" 
AI: Fetches remote updates â†’ Merges changes â†’ Keeps AI state current

User: "Push our AI improvements to the team"
AI: Pushes AI organizational changes â†’ Updates remote â†’ Confirms team sync
```

## Technical Details

### Command vs MCP Tools
- **Commands** (`/aipm-status`, `/aipm-init`, etc.) - High-level workflows with single approval
- **MCP Tools** (`get_project_state_analysis`, etc.) - Individual operations with separate approvals

### Available MCP Tools
The AI Project Manager provides 65+ MCP tools that commands use behind the scenes:
- Project management tools (initialize, status, blueprints)
- Task management tools (create, update, list, sidequests)  
- Context loading tools (themes, flows, escalation)
- File operations tools (read, analyze, cross-reference)
- Branch management tools (create, switch, merge, status)
- Session management tools (boot, persistence, restoration)
- Database tools (queries, analytics, optimization, backup, maintenance)

### Getting Help
- **`/aipm-help`** - Overview of all commands
- **`help_commands`** MCP tool - Detailed help system (AI uses automatically)
- **`help_commands` with specific command** - Detailed help for individual commands (AI uses automatically)

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happened when I said 'continue development'"
**Solution**: Use `/aipm-status` or `/aipm-resume` commands instead of natural language.

### "I don't know what state my project is in"
**Solution**: Use `/aipm-status` to get current state analysis and suggested next steps.

### "The AI isn't doing anything automatically"
**Solution**: Commands provide workflow approval. Use `/aipm-init` for initial setup, `/aipm-resume` for ongoing work.

### "I want to see all available options"
**Solution**: Use `/aipm-help` for command overview, or ask "show me detailed help" (AI will use `help_commands` tool automatically).
