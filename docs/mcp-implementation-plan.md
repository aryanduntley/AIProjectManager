# MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a single, monolithic MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI-driven project management capabilities. The server enables persistent context management, theme-based organization, and seamless session continuity for AI development workflows.

## Architecture Decision: Single MCP Server

**Chosen Approach**: Single MCP server with modular tool groups

**Rationale**:
- **Unified Project State**: All operations (tasks, files, themes, logs) require constant cross-referencing
- **Session Continuity**: Seamless AI session management requires one source of truth
- **Atomic Operations**: Complex workflows like "update task → modify code → log decisions → update themes" need transaction-like behavior
- **Context Loading**: Theme-based context loading requires coordinated access to multiple data types
