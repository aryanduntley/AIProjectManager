expand on database. need database directives
should noteworthy be database instead of jsonl? What about projectlogic?
what else could we use the database for. Think session persistence, uninterrupted workflow. Multi task and subtask order management. Status tracking. could more precise and extensive flow/theme/general connective file tracking be added? Directory README.json files, shoule they be replaced with a dtabase table(s)?
