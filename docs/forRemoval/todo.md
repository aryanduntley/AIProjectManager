database test is reflected in actual mcp code? Many fixes to database test, but code should have common database tasks and queries and should not be made up on the fly (normally), so we need to ensure that all database interactions follow the working method of the test to ensure the failures/issues of the test before fixes aren't duplicated in code.

context vs context_mode
database sessions. How are sessions being assessed in code? We cannot track an "end" session (when user ends a session, there is no processing after to ensure a session is ended). We can only assess a session start or new session. We must make sure we aren't relying on sessions as actual sessions where a start and stop would need to be known. discuss "session" use.

mcp-server/database/theme_flow_queries.py
update_flow_step_status
we need to ensure that the multi flow system relative to the databae is working.

Need database cleaning maintenance and backups (let's make this manual upon user's request. Need code in place for the backup process and upon user request, MCP executes backup code).

mcp-server full code review.

config.json review, map to directives. Ensure all configurable options (eg. true/false) are accounted for in directives (if true, do this, if false, do that) but also accounted for in the mcp code itself.

review directives and mcp flow regarding directives. Does it follow the instructions well end escalate directives/instructions context well.

ensure directives allow user to make decisions. project init should not be automatic. User should initiate. On init, we should have mcp-server discuss some user settings with user.
begin auto management and project progression (tasks, etc) at session start or wait for user command depeningon settins in config.

review directives escalation. How often should json be reviewed? How often should md? examples for escalation, directives on escalation. I am worried json will not be viewed as often as it should and compressed will likely be relied upon even when more directives context would likely be needed.

user main branch, not mcp main branch, should never be automatically pushed to. Must be explicit user request. Ensure no code or directives mention anything to do with pushing to or modifying user's main branch. 

node/npm ignore file update, and npm implementation update according to new git branch changes


======================

our directives are 3 layered. More detailed, human readable md files in docs/directives/?.md, more consolidated and more efficient for AI to read json files in mcp-s erver/reference/directives/?.json, and a compressed quick reference json mcp-server/core-context/directive-compressed.json. Further, the base index/reference for the various directives: docs/directives/directives.json mcp-server/reference/index.json our directives structure allow for a hierarchy for AI to follow for context needed. compressed directives are not explicit enough but allow for mild and routine tasks. More context is provided in the json files for detailed step by step directives on how to handle the various scenarios of the project management steps. And the human readable (which should almost exactly match the json) for more explanatory context if AI decides something is unclear and might need more explanation.


======================
Self-Testing Approach (Recommended)

  Setup:

  # Current structure:
  /home/eveningb4dawn/Desktop/Projects/AIPro
  jectManager/
  â”œâ”€â”€ mcp-server/           # MCP server 
  code (what we've been fixing)
  â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                 # Documentation 
  â”œâ”€â”€ projectManagement/    # Will be 
  created by MCP server
  â””â”€â”€ [your project files]  # Source code, 
  etc.

  How to test:

  1. Install the MCP server in this same
  directory
  2. Run the MCP server pointing to this
  same directory
  3. Connect Claude to test against this
  project
  4. Debug in real-time by editing the
  mcp-server/ code

  ðŸ”§ Implementation Steps:

  Step 1: Install MCP Server Locally

  cd /home/eveningb4dawn/Desktop/Projects/AI
  ProjectManager/

  # Make the MCP server installable locally
  pip install -e ./mcp-server/  # Editable 
  install

  Step 2: Configure Claude Code MCP

  Add to your Claude Code settings:
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "ai-project-manager": {
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["-m", "mcp_server"],
        "cwd": "/home/eveningb4dawn/Desktop/
  Projects/AIProjectManager/"
      }
    }
  }

  Step 3: Test & Debug Cycle

  # 1. Start MCP server (Claude will do this
   automatically)
  # 2. Use MCP tools via Claude
  # 3. See issues in real-time
  # 4. Edit mcp-server/ code to fix issues
  # 5. Restart MCP connection (changes will 
  be live)
  # 6. Test again
