# MCP Server Debugging Log

## Problem Statement
The AI Project Manager MCP server was failing to start with `python3 -m ai-pm-mcp` due to import errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issue was **absolute imports** throughout the codebase that failed when running as a Python module. When using `python3 -m ai-pm-mcp`, Python expects relative imports within the package.

## Failed Attempts & Lessons Learned

### Initial Symptom
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'
```

### Attempted Fix 1: Changed __main__.py import
- **What we tried**: Changed `from server import main` to `from .server import main`
- **Result**: Fixed the initial import but revealed deeper import issues in server.py

### Attempted Fix 2: Manual server.py import fixes  
- **What we tried**: Changed `from core.config_manager` to `from .core.config_manager`
- **Result**: Partial success but many more files had similar issues

### Failed Approach: Bulk import fixing script
- **What we tried**: Created a script that replaced `from core.` with `from ...core.`
- **Result**: Over-corrected with too many dots, causing "attempted relative import beyond top-level package" errors

## Successful Solution

### Step 1: Fixed __main__.py
```python
# Before
from server import main

# After  
from .server import main
```

### Step 2: Fixed server.py core imports
```python
# Before
from core.config_manager import ConfigManager
from core.mcp_api import MCPToolRegistry

# After
from .core.config_manager import ConfigManager
from .core.mcp_api import MCPToolRegistry
```

### Step 3: Systematic import fixing
Created `fix_imports_correct.py` that properly handled relative imports based on file depth:
- Root level files: `from .core.`
- Subdirectory files: `from ..core.`

### Step 4: Enhanced debugging
Added comprehensive logging to server.py:
```python
# Enhanced logging format with function names and line numbers
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(funcName)s:%(lineno)d - %(message)s'
)

# Startup debugging info
logger.info(f"Python path: {sys.path}")
logger.info(f"Server file location: {__file__}")
logger.info(f"Working directory: {Path.cwd()}")
```

## Final Working State

### Test Command
```bash
python3 -m ai-pm-mcp
```

### Expected Output
```
2025-07-29 19:22:40,193 - ai-pm-mcp.core.mcp_api - INFO - register_all_tools:100 - Registered 53 tools successfully
2025-07-29 19:22:40,193 - ai-pm-mcp.server - INFO - initialize:69 - AI Project Manager MCP Server initialized successfully
2025-07-29 19:22:40,195 - ai-pm-mcp.server - INFO - run:84 - MCP Server ready for connections
```

### Verification
- ✅ Server starts without import errors
- ✅ Loads all 53 tools successfully  
- ✅ Responds to MCP protocol requests
- ✅ Enhanced debugging provides clear error tracking

## Files Modified
1. `/ai-pm-mcp/__main__.py` - Fixed main server import
2. `/ai-pm-mcp/server.py` - Fixed core imports + added debugging
3. `/ai-pm-mcp/core/mcp_api.py` - Fixed all tool imports
4. Multiple files in `/core/`, `/tools/`, `/database/`, `/utils/` - Fixed relative imports

## Prevention for Future
1. **Always use relative imports** within the ai-pm-mcp package
2. **Test module execution** with `python3 -m ai-pm-mcp` during development
3. **Use the enhanced logging** to quickly identify import issues
4. **Check this log** before attempting new import fixes

## Key Debugging Commands
```bash
# Test server startup
timeout 10 python3 -m ai-pm-mcp 2>&1 | head -20

# Check for import errors
python3 -c "import ai_pm_mcp; print('Imports OK')"

# Verify tools loading
grep "Registered.*tools successfully" <(timeout 5 python3 -m ai-pm-mcp 2>&1)
```

## Claude Code Configuration Update

### Issue with .claude.json
After fixing the import issues, the Claude Code configuration also needed updating:

**Before (incorrect):**
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "ai-project-manager": {
    "command": "python3",
    "args": ["-m", "server"],
    "cwd": "/home/eveningb4dawn/Desktop/Projects/AIProjectManager/ai-pm-mcp-production/"
  }
}
```

**After (correct):**
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "ai-project-manager": {
    "command": "python3", 
    "args": ["-m", "ai-pm-mcp"],
    "cwd": "/home/eveningb4dawn/Desktop/Projects/AIProjectManager/"
  }
}
```

**Key changes:**
1. **Module name**: Changed from `-m server` to `-m ai-pm-mcp` (matches the package name)
2. **Working directory**: Changed from `ai-pm-mcp-production/` to parent directory `/AIProjectManager/`
3. **Directory structure**: No longer need separate production directory - use development directly

This matches the successful test command: `python3 -m ai-pm-mcp` from the `/AIProjectManager/` directory.

**Status: RESOLVED** - MCP server now starts successfully and loads all tools with correct Claude Code configuration.
