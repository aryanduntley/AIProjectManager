# Unified Git Implementation Plan: Git-Like Instance Management with Root-Level Project Tracking

## Executive Summary

This unified implementation combines root-level Git project tracking with Git-like instance management for MCP organizational state. It provides a simple, familiar approach that solves both "users make changes outside AI" and "multiple instances coordination" problems using proven Git-like patterns.

**Key Innovation**: MCP instances operate like Git branches - isolated development with merge-based integration to a canonical `main` instance.

## Problem Statement

### Critical Issues Addressed
1. **External Code Changes**: Users modify project code outside MCP sessions, requiring state detection and reconciliation
2. **Multiple Instance Coordination**: Team members or parallel AI processes need to coordinate organizational state changes
3. **Complexity Overload**: Previous plans were too complex with bloated coordination structures
4. **State Consistency**: Need single source of truth while allowing independent work

### Design Principles
- **Git-Like Simplicity**: Use familiar branching/merging patterns developers already understand
- **Single Source of Truth**: `main` instance is canonical, all others are working copies
- **Clean Architecture**: No bloated coordination files or complex three-layer systems
- **Familiar Workflows**: Leverage proven Git conflict resolution patterns

```

### Instance Naming Convention
Instances must be named descriptively based on their primary purpose:

**Format**: `{theme/area}-{purpose}-{user}` (if user-specific) or `{theme/area}-{purpose}` (if autonomous)

**Examples**:
- `auth-enhancement-alice` - Alice working on authentication improvements
- `payment-integration` - Autonomous work on payment system integration  
- `ui-components-refactor-bob` - Bob refactoring UI components
- `database-optimization` - Database performance improvements
- `api-security-audit` - Security audit of API endpoints

## Git-Like Instance Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Instance Creation ("Git Branch")
**Command Equivalent**: `git checkout -b feature/auth-enhancement`
**MCP Equivalent**: `mcp instance create auth-enhancement-alice --from main`

**Process**:
1. **Validate Main State**: Ensure main instance is in clean, consistent state
2. **Create Instance Workspace**: Copy `projectManagement/` to `.mcp-instances/active/auth-enhancement-alice/`
3. **Initialize Instance Database**: Copy main `project.db` to instance workspace
4. **Create Instance Metadata**: Generate `.mcp-branch-info.json` with creation details
5. **Register Instance**: Add to active instance registry
6. **Lock Prevention**: Prevent concurrent instances with same name

**Instance Metadata** (`.mcp-branch-info.json`):
```json
{
  "instanceId": "auth-enhancement-alice",
  "createdFrom": "main",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-23T10:30:00Z",
  "createdBy": "alice",
  "purpose": "Enhance authentication system with OAuth and MFA",
  "primaryThemes": ["authentication", "security"],
  "relatedFlows": ["authentication-flow.json", "security-flow.json"],
  "expectedDuration": "3-5 days",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Phase 2: Independent Work ("Git Commits")
**Process**:
- Instance operates completely independently using its own `projectManagement/` copy
- Instance database tracks all changes locally
- No coordination overhead during active development
- Main instance remains unaffected and available for other work
- Multiple instances can work simultaneously on different areas

**Instance Isolation Benefits**:
- ✅ No coordination complexity during development
- ✅ No blocking other instances or main
- ✅ Full access to all MCP features within instance scope
- ✅ Clean rollback capability (delete instance if needed)

### Phase 3: Integration ("Git Merge")
**Command Equivalent**: `git merge feature/auth-enhancement`
**MCP Equivalent**: `mcp instance merge auth-enhancement-alice --to main`

**Process**:
1. **Pre-Merge Validation**:
   - Verify main instance is in clean state
   - Validate instance is ready for merge (no incomplete tasks)
   - Check for external project code changes since instance creation

2. **Change Analysis**:
   - Compare instance `projectManagement/` with main
   - Identify organizational file differences
   - Detect database schema/data conflicts
   - Generate change summary for review

3. **Conflict Detection**:
   - **Theme Conflicts**: Same theme modified in both main and instance
   - **Task Conflicts**: Task status changes in both locations
   - **Flow Conflicts**: Flow definitions diverged
   - **Database Conflicts**: Incompatible database changes

4. **Main Instance Decision Authority**:
   - **Main instance is PRIMARY DECISION MAKER** for all conflict resolution
   - Main instance user(s) presented with conflicts and resolution options
   - Main instance chooses resolution strategy for each conflict
   - No complex coordination - main decides, others adapt

5. **Resolution Application**:
   - Apply resolved changes to main `projectManagement/`
   - Update main database with merged state
   - Archive instance to `.mcp-instances/completed/`
   - Log merge decisions in `.mcp-merge-log.jsonl`

## Conflict Resolution Patterns (Git-Like)

### Theme Conflict Example
```
<<<<<<< main
{
  "theme": "authentication",
  "files": ["src/auth/login.js", "src/auth/register.js"],
  "linkedThemes": ["user-management"]
}
=======
{
  "theme": "authentication", 
  "files": ["src/auth/login.js", "src/auth/register.js", "src/auth/oauth.js", "src/auth/mfa.js"],
  "linkedThemes": ["user-management", "security", "notifications"]
}
>>>>>>> auth-enhancement-alice
```

**Resolution Options**:
1. **Accept Instance Changes**: Use Alice's enhanced authentication theme
2. **Keep Main**: Reject instance changes, keep main version
3. **Manual Merge**: Combine specific elements from both versions
4. **Split Approach**: Create separate themes for new functionality

### Task Status Conflict Example
```
Main Instance: Task "implement-oauth" status = "completed"
Alice Instance: Task "implement-oauth" has 3 new subtasks, status = "in-progress"

Resolution: Main instance decides to accept Alice's subtasks but maintain completed status, 
creating new task "oauth-enhancements" for the additional work.
```

## Root-Level Git Integration

### Project Code Change Detection
**Process**:
1. **Session Boot Detection**: Compare current Git HEAD with last known state in main database
2. **Change Analysis**: Identify modified, added, deleted files since last MCP session
3. **Theme Impact Assessment**: Determine which themes are affected by code changes
4. **Organizational Reconciliation**: Update themes, flows, and tasks to reflect code reality
5. **User Notification**: Present changes and AI adaptations for approval

**Integration with Instance Management**:
- Code changes detected in main instance only
- Instance creation includes current Git state snapshot
- Merge process reconciles both organizational changes AND code changes
- Main instance has authority over code change interpretation

### Git Configuration
**Updated `.gitignore`**:
```gitignore
# MCP Instance Management - Track Structure, Not Content
.mcp-instances/active/*/projectManagement/UserSettings/
.mcp-instances/active/*/projectManagement/database/backups/
.mcp-instances/*/logs/
.mcp-instances/*/temp/

# Project Management - Track Organizational State
projectManagement/UserSettings/
projectManagement/database/backups/
projectManagement/.mcp-session-*
```

**Tracked in Git**:
- All project source code (existing behavior)
- Main `projectManagement/` organizational state
- Instance management structure (`.mcp-instances/`)
- Merge history and conflict resolution logs
- Instance metadata and branch information

**NOT Tracked**:
- User-specific settings (`UserSettings/`)
- Database backups
- Temporary session files
- Active work logs during development

## Implementation Phases

**Deliverables:**
- Git repository evaluation and initialization at project root

    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    project_root_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    current_git_hash TEXT,
    last_known_hash TEXT,
    last_sync_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    change_summary TEXT,

    instance_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_from TEXT DEFAULT 'main',
    created_by TEXT,
    purpose TEXT,
    primary_themes TEXT, -- JSON array
    related_flows TEXT,  -- JSON array

);

-- Merge history and conflict resolution
CREATE TABLE instance_merges (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    merge_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    source_instance TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_instance TEXT DEFAULT 'main',
    merge_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, in-progress, completed, failed
