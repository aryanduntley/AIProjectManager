# Task Management Directives

## 6.1 Task File Structure Requirements

**Directive**: All task files integrate with themes, milestones, and multi-flow system through hybrid file-database approach.

**Database Integration**: Task status, progress, and relationships tracked in real-time via database while task definitions remain in files for user visibility and modification.

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: Real-Time State Preservation Directive**

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: After EVERY subtask completion, step completion, or any work unit of any sort, ALL organizational files and database records that relate MUST be immediately updated before proceeding.

**Purpose**: Ensure seamless session restoration and prevent loss of work in case of premature session termination.

**Update Requirements**:
- **Database**: Update task/subtask status, progress percentages, completion timestamps
- **Task Files**: Update subtask status, progress, completion criteria  
- **Session Database**: Save current context snapshot
- **Implementation Plans**: Update phase progress if applicable
- **Related Themes**: Update any affected theme relationships
- **Event Logging**: Log completion event for analytics and recovery

**Session Restoration Goal**: Upon any restart, MCP/AI must be able to resume exactly where work left off with minimal review and zero lost progress.

**Implementation**: This requirement is built into every tool and must be executed atomically - if any update fails, the entire completion step fails and must be retried.

**Required Task File Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "TASK-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS",
  "title": "Clear, concise task title",
  "description": "Detailed task description",
  "status": "pending|in-progress|completed|blocked",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "milestone": "M-XX",
  "primaryTheme": "theme-name",
  "relatedThemes": ["theme1", "theme2"],
  "contextMode": "theme-focused|theme-expanded|project-wide", // AI determines at task creation
  "createdDate": "ISO timestamp",
  "lastModified": "ISO timestamp",
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "id": "ST-XX",
      "description": "Subtask description",
      "status": "pending|in-progress|completed",
      "flowReferences": [
        {
          "flowId": "flow-id",
          "flowFile": "domain-flow.json",
          "steps": ["step-id-1", "step-id-2"]
        }
      ],
      "files": ["affected/files.ts"],
      "estimatedTime": "duration"
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": ["TASK-ID-1", "TASK-ID-2"],
  "blockers": ["Description of blocking issues"],
  "notes": ["Task progress notes"],
  "completionCriteria": ["Criteria for completion"]
}
```

**Task File Structure** (`reference/templates/task-active.json`):
- **Core Identity**: `taskId`, `title`, `description`, `created`, `lastUpdated`, `status`
- **Milestone Integration**: References milestone from `completion-path.json`
- **Theme Integration**: Primary theme and related themes for context loading
- **Subtasks**: Array of subtasks with individual scope, flow references, and file lists
- **Multi-Flow Integration**: Each subtask references specific flows with flowId, flowFile, and step IDs
- **Context Mode**: Per-subtask context mode (theme-focused/theme-expanded/project-wide)
- **Dependencies**: Inter-subtask dependencies and blockers
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, e2e, and security testing requirements
- **Documentation**: API docs, user guides, and technical specifications

**Sidequest File Structure** (`examples/sidequest.json`):
- **Sidequest Identity**: `sidequestId`, `parentTask`, `title`, `description`
- **Scope Context**: `scopeDescription`, `reason`, `urgency`, `impactOnParentTask`
- **Inheritance**: Inherits milestone and themes from parent task
- **Subtasks**: Similar structure to main tasks but with sidequest-specific IDs
- **Completion Trigger**: Defines what constitutes completion
- **Notes**: Additional considerations and observations

**Key Integration Requirements**:
- All tasks must reference valid milestones from `projectManagement/Tasks/completion-path.json`
- All subtasks must reference specific user flows and experience steps
- Context mode determines theme loading scope
- File lists enable targeted context loading
- Dependencies ensure proper execution order
- Tasks should reference active implementation plans when applicable

## 6.2 Task Lifecycle Management

**Directive**: Follow proper task lifecycle and status management.

**Status Transitions**:
- `pending` â†’ `in-progress`: When task work begins
- `in-progress` â†’ `completed`: When all completion criteria met
- `in-progress` â†’ `blocked`: When external dependency prevents progress
- `blocked` â†’ `in-progress`: When blocker resolved
- Any status â†’ `pending`: When task needs to be reset

**Update Requirements**:
- Update status immediately when changed
- Document status change reasons
- Maintain task history for retrospection
- Archive completed tasks according to retention policy

## 6.3 Multiple Sidequest Management Protocol

**Directive**: Support multiple simultaneous sidequests for tangential work discovered during task execution, with configurable limits to prevent overwhelming complexity.

### Multiple Sidequest Configuration

**Configuration Settings** (`.ai-pm-config.json`):
```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "sidequestManagement": {
      "allowMultipleSidequests": true,
      "maxSimultaneousSidequests": 3,
      "warnWhenApproachingLimit": true,
      "limitExceededBehavior": "prompt_user_options"
    }
  }
}
```

### Sidequest Limit Management

**When Limit is Reached:**
- AI must check active sidequest count before creating new sidequests
- If limit exceeded, AI presents user with options:
  1. **Wait**: "You have reached the maximum of [X] active sidequests. Please complete current sidequests before creating new ones."
  2. **Modify Existing**: "Would you like to modify an existing sidequest to include this new requirement?"
  3. **Replace**: "Would you like to complete and replace one of the current sidequests?"
  4. **Increase Limit**: "Would you like to temporarily increase the sidequest limit for this session?"

**Approaching Limit Warning:**
When at 80% of limit: "You currently have [X] of [Y] maximum sidequests active. Consider completing some before creating additional sidequests."

### Sidequest Workflow Mechanics

**When to Create a Sidequest:**
- User notices missing functionality during task execution (e.g., "registration isn't handled" during checkout implementation)
- AI discovers dependency gaps that need immediate resolution
- Technical debt or security issues are identified that block progress
- User requests exploration or implementation of related but non-core functionality

### Subtask Sidequest Tracking

**During Subtask Execution, AI Must:**
1. **Check for Related Sidequests**: Review `relatedSidequests` field in current subtask
2. **Update Sidequest Status**: Monitor progress of related sidequests
3. **Coordinate Dependencies**: Consider sidequest completion when planning subtask work
4. **Update Tracking**: Add new sidequests to `relatedSidequests` array when created

**Subtask Structure with Sidequest Tracking**:
```json
{
  "id": "ST-02",
  "title": "User Registration API",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "progress": 75,
  "relatedSidequests": [
    {
      "sidequestId": "SQ-20250711T140000-001",
      "title": "Add Rate Limiting to Authentication Endpoints", 
      "status": "completed|in-progress|pending",
      "impact": "minimal|moderate|significant",
      "createdDate": "2025-07-11T17:00:00Z",
      "completedDate": "2025-07-11T16:45:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Before Creating New Sidequests:**
1. **Check Current Count**: Query active sidequests for current task across all subtasks
2. **Validate Against Limit**: Compare against `maxSimultaneousSidequests` setting  
3. **Present Options if Exceeded**: Offer user choices for handling limit
4. **Update Subtask Tracking**: Add new sidequest to current subtask's `relatedSidequests` array

### Configuration Settings Details

**`allowMultipleSidequests` (boolean, default: true)**:
- `true`: Enable multiple simultaneous sidequests per task
- `false`: Restrict to single sidequest at a time (legacy behavior)

**`maxSimultaneousSidequests` (integer, default: 3)**:
- Maximum number of active sidequests allowed per task
- Range: 1-10 (higher values may cause complexity issues)
- AI enforces this limit before creating new sidequests

**`warnWhenApproachingLimit` (boolean, default: true)**:
- `true`: Warn user when reaching 80% of sidequest limit
- `false`: Only notify when limit is actually exceeded

**`limitExceededBehavior` (string, default: "prompt_user_options")**:
- `"prompt_user_options"`: Present user with multiple resolution options
- `"block_creation"`: Simply refuse to create additional sidequests
- `"auto_queue"`: Queue new sidequests until existing ones complete

**Critical Workflow Steps:**

1. **Context Preservation Phase**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Save current task state, including:
     - Current subtask ID and progress percentage
     - Loaded themes and files in context
     - Any in-progress work or temporary state
     - Exact position in implementation flow
   - Document why sidequest is needed in `reason` field
   - Assess impact on parent task (`minimal|moderate|significant`)

2. **Sidequest Activation Phase**:
   - Create sidequest file using template structure
   - **Pause parent task** - mark parent task as `blocked` with reason
   - Switch AI focus completely to sidequest
   - Load appropriate context for sidequest theme (may be different from parent)
   - Begin sidequest execution as independent work stream

3. **Sidequest Completion Phase**:
   - Complete all sidequest subtasks and acceptance criteria
   - **Update parent task if needed** - if sidequest changed needs or details of original task, update parent task file accordingly
   - Archive sidequest file to `Tasks/archive/sidequests/`
   - **Restore parent task context** - reload exact saved state
   - Resume parent task from exact pause point
   - Update parent task with any integration needed from sidequest work

### Context Switching Protocol

**Pause Main Task:**
```
AI Message: "I'm creating a sidequest to handle [requirement]. Pausing current work on [subtask] at [progress]..."
- Save current subtask state and loaded context
- Mark parent task as blocked with sidequest reference
- Set status message indicating sidequest in progress
```

**Resume Main Task:**
```
AI Message: "Sidequest '[title]' completed. Resuming [parent task] at [subtask] where we left off..."
- Restore exact subtask state and progress
- Reload previously loaded themes and files
- Continue implementation from exact pause point
```

### Sidequest File Structure

**Enhanced Template** (`reference/templates/sidequest.json`):
```json
{
  "sidequestId": "SQ-20250711T140000-001",
  "parentTask": "TASK-20250711T140000",
  "title": "Descriptive sidequest title",
  "description": "Detailed description of what needs to be accomplished",
  "scopeDescription": "Specific explanation of why this sidequest was created",
  "reason": "User discovered missing registration during checkout implementation",
  "urgency": "low|medium|high",
  "impactOnParentTask": "minimal|moderate|significant",
  
  "contextPreservation": {
    "pausedSubtaskId": "ST-02",
    "pausedProgress": 75,
    "loadedThemes": ["payment", "checkout"],
    "loadedFiles": ["CheckoutController.ts", "PaymentService.ts"],
    "pauseTimestamp": "2025-07-11T15:30:00Z",
    "notes": "Paused during payment validation implementation"
  },
  
  "status": "pending|in-progress|completed",
  "priority": "low|medium|high",
  "themes": {
    "primary": "registration",
    "related": ["authentication", "user-management"]
  },
  
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "id": "SQ-ST-01",
      "title": "Create registration form component",
      "status": "pending",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ],
  
  "completionTrigger": {
    "type": "all-subtasks-complete",
    "additionalRequirements": [
      "Integration with parent task verified",
      "No regressions in parent task functionality"
    ]
  }
}
```

### AI Behavior Requirements

**Strict Workflow Adherence:**
- **NEVER** continue parent task work while sidequest is active
- **ALWAYS** preserve complete context when creating sidequest
- **MUST** restore exact context when resuming parent task
- **REQUIRED** to communicate workflow transitions clearly to user

**User Communication:**
```
Example Flow:
User: "Wait, I notice registration isn't handled in this checkout flow"
AI: "You're right - registration is missing. I'll create a sidequest to implement registration functionality. 

Pausing current checkout implementation at subtask 'Payment Validation' (75% complete)...
Creating sidequest: 'Implement User Registration System'
Switching context to registration theme...

Working on registration sidequest..."

[After completing registration sidequest]

AI: "Registration sidequest completed successfully. 
Resuming checkout implementation...
Restored context: Payment Validation subtask at 75% complete
Continuing with payment validation implementation..."
```

### Validation Rules

**Before Creating Sidequest:**
- Sidequest work must be genuinely independent from current subtask
- Must have clear completion criteria
- Should not create circular dependencies

**Before Resuming Parent Task:**
- All sidequest acceptance criteria must be met
- Parent task file updated if sidequest changed original task needs or requirements
- Sidequest file must be archived
- Integration points with parent task must be documented
- No breaking changes introduced that affect parent task

## 6.4 Completion Path Integration

**Directive**: All tasks must align with project completion path and milestones.

**Integration Requirements**:
- Every task must reference a milestone from projectManagement/Tasks/completion-path.json
- Task completion moves milestone progress forward
- Milestone completion unlocks dependent milestones
- Changes to completion path require user approval
- Track progress metrics and projections

**Completion Path Structure**:
```json
{
  "completionObjective": "Clear end goal definition",
  "metadata": {
    "createdDate": "ISO timestamp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "estimatedCompletion": "target date"
  },
  "milestones": [
    {
      "id": "M-01",
      "description": "Milestone description",
      "status": "pending|in-progress|completed",
      "dependencies": ["M-00"],
      "deliverables": ["List of deliverables"],
      "relatedTasks": ["TASK-IDs"],
      "estimatedEffort": "duration",
      "completedOn": "ISO timestamp"
    }
  ],
  "riskFactors": ["Identified risks and mitigation"],
  "progressMetrics": {
    "currentProgress": 0.0-1.0,
    "estimatedCompletion": "projected date",
    "velocity": "tasks per unit time"
  }
}
```

## 6.5 Parallel Task Management

**Directive**: Support multiple concurrent tasks with proper coordination.

**Parallel Task Rules**:
- Only one task can be `in-progress` per session
- Tasks can be `pending` or `blocked` concurrently
- Sidequests can run parallel to main tasks
- Coordinate shared file modifications
- Prevent conflicting changes to same files
- Document dependencies and relationships

## 6.6 Multi-Flow Task Integration

**Directive**: Tasks must properly integrate with the multi-flow system for efficient context loading and validation.

### Multi-Flow Task Requirements

**Flow References Structure**:
- **Flow ID**: Unique identifier for the flow within its flow file
- **Flow File**: Specific flow file containing the referenced flow
- **Step IDs**: Specific step identifiers within the flow
- **Cross-Flow Dependencies**: References to flows in other flow files

**Task Integration Rules**:
- Each subtask must specify flowId, flowFile, and specific step IDs
- Tasks spanning multiple flows must reference all relevant flow files
- Referenced flow files must exist in ProjectFlow/ directory
- Referenced step IDs must exist within specified flow files
- All flow files must be registered in flow-index.json

### Flow Scope Context Loading for Tasks

**Initial Context Loading**:
1. **Flow Scope**: Load only flow files referenced in task for initial context
2. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize initial memory usage with targeted flow loading
3. **Automatic Expansion**: AI expands to theme scope when flow scope insufficient
4. **No Barriers**: Expansion from flow scope to theme scope requires no approval

**Context Escalation Logic**:
- **Flow Scope Insufficient**: AI determines when flow context is inadequate
- **Theme Scope Authority**: Theme scope is always available for complete context
- **Self-Managed**: AI manages context expansion without user intervention
- **Resource Efficiency**: Start minimal, expand as needed

**Multi-Flow Validation**:
- **Flow File Existence**: Validate all referenced flow files exist
- **Step ID Validation**: Ensure all step IDs exist within referenced flows
- **Cross-Flow Dependencies**: Validate dependencies declared in flow-index.json
- **Flow Index Consistency**: Ensure flow-index.json is always up-to-date

### Flow Reference Structure

```json
{
  "flowReferences": [
    {
      "flowId": "user-registration-flow",
      "flowFile": "authentication-flow.json",
      "steps": ["URF-001", "URF-002", "URF-003"]
    },
    {
      "flowId": "payment-processing-flow",
      "flowFile": "payment-flow.json", 
      "steps": ["PPF-001"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits of Multi-Flow Integration

**Efficient Context Loading**:
- **Targeted Loading**: Load only relevant flow files for specific tasks
- **Resource Management**: Optimize memory usage with selective flow loading
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle projects with 20+ flows efficiently

**Precise Flow Tracking**:
- **Step-Level Precision**: Reference specific flow steps for implementation
- **Cross-Flow Coordination**: Manage dependencies between different flow files
- **Progress Validation**: Track completion against specific flow requirements

## 6.7 High-Priority Task Management System

**Directive**: Detect and escalate issues that exceed current task scope through structured high-priority task creation.

### Purpose and Scope

**System Purpose**: Provide dedicated resources and attention for complex issues that cannot be resolved within normal task boundaries. This system handles scenarios where AI discovers issues during regular task execution that exceed the current task scope.

**When to Use High-Priority Tasks**:
- Issues affecting multiple themes or systems simultaneously
- Architectural changes or major refactoring requirements
- Security vulnerabilities or compliance issues
- Performance bottlenecks requiring system-wide optimization
- Breaking changes affecting multiple components
- Complex integration challenges between systems
- Technical debt that blocks further development

### Scope Escalation Workflow

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Issue Detection**: AI detects issue during regular task execution using natural reasoning capabilities
2. **Scope Assessment**: AI assesses if issue exceeds current task scope and requires escalation
3. **Impact Presentation**: AI presents scope-exceeding issue to user with clear impact assessment
4. **User Approval**: User approves escalation to high-priority task
5. **Task Creation**: AI creates `HIGH-TASK-<timestamp>.json` file with enhanced priority
6. **Plan Creation** (Optional): AI may also create `H-<timestamp>-<description>.md` implementation plan
7. **System Surfacing**: System automatically surfaces high-priority items in status and boot sequences

### High-Priority Task File Structure

**Naming Convention**: `HIGH-TASK-<timestamp>.json`

**Enhanced Task Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "HIGH-TASK-20250711T140000",
  "title": "[HIGH PRIORITY] Security Vulnerability Remediation",
  "description": "Address authentication bypass vulnerability discovered during payment integration",
  "status": "pending|in-progress|completed|blocked",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "isHighPriorityTask": true,
  "escalationReason": "Security vulnerability affecting multiple authentication systems",
  "impactAssessment": {
    "affectedSystems": ["authentication", "payment", "user-management"],
    "severity": "high|critical",
    "businessImpact": "Blocks production deployment until resolved",
    "technicalComplexity": "Requires coordination across multiple themes"
  },
  "milestone": "M-XX",
  "primaryTheme": "security",
  "relatedThemes": ["authentication", "payment", "user-management"],
  "contextMode": "project-wide",
  "escalationDate": "ISO timestamp",
  "originalTask": "TASK-20250711T120000",
  "requiresEscalation": true,
  "existHighPriority": true
}
```

### Database Integration

**Event Logging**: High-priority task creation logged using `EventQueries.log_scope_escalation_issue()`

**Priority Flags**:
- `exist_high_priority=true`: Marks event as high-priority for system surfacing
- `requires_escalation=true`: Indicates scope escalation was required

**Resolution Tracking**: Use `EventQueries.mark_escalation_resolved()` when high-priority work completed

### Implementation Plan Integration

**H- Naming Convention**: `H-<timestamp>-<description>.md`

**High-Priority Implementation Plans**:
- Created for complex high-priority tasks requiring strategic planning
- Use existing implementation plan template with priority markers
- Plan title includes `[HIGH PRIORITY]` indicator
- Priority field set to 'HIGH' in metadata
- Documents escalation reason and impact assessment
- Estimates timeline and expertise needed
- Identifies risks and mitigation strategies

**Integration with HIGH-TASK Files**:
- HIGH-TASK files reference H- implementation plans
- Implementation plan provides strategic framework for high-priority task execution
- Plan phases align with HIGH-TASK subtask completion

### User Communication Protocol

**Initial Detection Presentation**:
```
AI: "I've identified an issue that exceeds the current task scope:

**Issue**: Authentication bypass vulnerability in payment integration
**Impact**: Affects authentication, payment, and user-management systems
**Scope Assessment**: Requires coordination across multiple themes and architectural changes

**Recommendation**: This issue should be escalated to a high-priority task for dedicated attention and proper resolution.

**Options**:
1. Create HIGH-TASK with implementation plan
2. Address within current task (may cause delays and incomplete resolution)
3. Defer to future milestone (not recommended for security issues)

Would you like me to create a high-priority task for this issue?"
```

**Escalation Recommendation**: Explain why current task cannot handle the issue properly and the benefits of dedicated high-priority attention.

**Status Updates**: Keep user informed of high-priority work progress with regular updates and milestone notifications.

### Automatic System Surfacing

**Status Command Integration**: HIGH-TASK files appear prominently in `/status` output with priority indicators and escalation reasons.

**Session Boot Detection**: High-priority items automatically detected and prioritized during session start:
- Scan Tasks/active/ directory for HIGH-TASK-*.json files
- Scan Implementations/active/ directory for H-*.md implementation plans
- Query database for events with exist_high_priority=true
- Present high-priority items prominently with recommendation for immediate attention

**Database Query Optimization**: Efficient time-limited queries (30 days) to prevent performance issues in large projects.

### Configuration Settings

**High-Priority Detection**: `tasks.highPriorityDetection` (boolean, default: true)
- Enable automatic detection and escalation of scope-exceeding issues
- Can be disabled for projects that prefer manual escalation only

### Workflow Integration

**Task Execution Flow**:
1. AI working on regular task execution
2. Discovers issue requiring scope escalation
3. Pauses current work to present escalation recommendation
4. Creates HIGH-TASK and optional H- plan upon user approval
5. System surfaces high-priority items in status and future boot sequences
6. High-priority work follows same context loading and execution patterns as regular tasks

**Context Preservation**: When escalating to high-priority tasks, preserve current work context for later resumption if needed.

**Priority Workflow**: High-priority tasks can interrupt regular task flow and receive immediate attention when surfaced during session boot.

### Benefits of High-Priority Task System

**Structured Escalation**: Provides formal process for handling scope-exceeding issues rather than trying to squeeze complex issues into inadequate task boundaries.

**Dedicated Attention**: High-priority tasks receive focused resources and strategic planning through optional implementation plans.

**System Integration**: Automatic surfacing ensures high-priority items don't get lost and receive immediate attention during work sessions.

**Impact Assessment**: Clear documentation of issue scope, affected systems, and escalation reasoning for informed decision-making.

**Performance Optimization**: Time-limited database queries prevent system slowdown in large projects while maintaining effective high-priority detection.

## 6.8 Completion Path Tracking with Flow Integration

### Enhanced Completion Path Management

**Core Structure:**
- MCP will manage a structured file at `projectManagement/Tasks/completion-path.json`
- This file provides a hierarchical, evolving list of major objectives leading to a finalized project
- A required top-level `completionObjective` string defines the true end goal (e.g. "Launch stable MVP on mainnet with full payment and storefront features")
- AI will maintain and update this list between sessions, but all changes require user approval
- File format is JSON (not JSONL) for structural clarity and efficient traversal by AI
- **TODO Review Milestone**: A dedicated milestone for reviewing and resolving all TODO items from `Placeholders/todos.jsonl` must be included before project completion

**TODO Review Requirements:**
- **Mandatory Pre-Completion**: All TODO items in `Placeholders/todos.jsonl` must be reviewed and resolved before project completion
- **User-Initiated Review**: TODO review can be initiated at any time upon user request
- **Implementation Process**: When TODO review is triggered:
  1. Create implementation plan based on TODO complexity and priority
  2. Generate task list to systematically address all TODO items
  3. Work continues until `todos.jsonl` is empty (all items handled)
- **Resolution Options**: TODO items can be:
  - Implemented as full features
  - Converted to proper implementations
  - Documented as future work (with user approval)
  - Removed if no longer relevant

**User Flow Integration Requirements:**
- **Required Flows**: Each milestone must specify `requiredFlows` array with user flow completion requirements
- **Flow Validation**: Milestones cannot be completed until all required user flows reach specified status
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion percentage tracking for each required user flow
- **Flow Dependencies**: Clear mapping between milestone deliverables and user experience steps

**Enhanced Milestone Structure:**
```json
{
  "completionObjective": "Deploy finished ChainSale app with all defined features, tested, stable, and production-ready",
  "milestones": [
    {
      "id": "M-02",
      "description": "Complete user authentication and payment processing",
      "status": "in-progress",
      "requiredFlows": [
        {
          "flowId": "user-registration-flow",
          "requiredStatus": "complete",
          "currentStatus": "in-progress", 
          "completionPercentage": 75
        },
        {
          "flowId": "payment-processing-flow",
          "requiredStatus": "complete",
          "currentStatus": "needs-analyze",
          "completionPercentage": 0
        }
      ],
      "relatedTasks": ["TASK-20250708T171400"],
      "implementationPlans": [
        {
          "id": "M02-v1-authentication-system",
          "filename": "M02-v1-authentication-system.md",
          "status": "active",
          "version": "v1",
          "createdDate": "2025-07-02T09:00:00Z",
          "description": "Authentication system implementation plan"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Plan Integration:**
- **Plan References**: Each milestone references its implementation plan files
- **Phase Tracking**: Implementation plan phases align with milestone progress
- **Strategic Continuity**: Plans bridge high-level milestones to tactical execution
- **Plan Lifecycle**: Plans archived upon milestone completion, new plan created for next milestone

**Milestone Completion Validation:**
- **Flow Completion Check**: All required user flows must reach specified status
- **Implementation Plan Validation**: All implementation plan phases must be complete
- **Deliverable Verification**: All milestone deliverables must be validated
- **Quality Gates**: Success metrics and quality criteria must be met

**Progress Tracking Integration:**
- **Flow Progress**: Real-time tracking of user flow step completion percentages
- **Milestone Progress**: Calculated from flow completion and implementation plan phases
- **Overall Progress**: Project-wide completion percentage based on milestone progress
- **Predictive Analytics**: Estimated completion dates based on current velocity

**User Approval Requirements:**
- **Milestone Changes**: Any changes to milestone structure require user approval
- **Flow Requirements**: Changes to required user flows must be approved
- **Completion Criteria**: Modifications to success criteria need user confirmation
- **Implementation Plan Updates**: Major changes to implementation approach require approval

**Benefits:**
- **Clear Progression**: Explicit mapping from high-level goals to tactical implementation
- **Validation Gates**: Prevents milestone completion without proper user flow validation
- **Strategic Context**: Implementation plans provide detailed execution strategy
- **Session Continuity**: AI can resume work with full strategic and tactical context

## 6.9 Project Flow Status Tracking System

**Directive**: Provide detailed progress tracking for user flows with step-level status management and milestone integration.

### Flow-Level Status Tracking
- **Overall Flow Status**: `pending`, `in-progress`, `complete`, `needs-review`, `needs-analyze`
- **Completion Percentage**: Calculated from individual step completion status
- **Integration with Milestones**: Flows referenced in milestone `requiredFlows` array
- **Progress Validation**: Milestone completion blocked until required flows complete

### Step-Level Status Tracking
- **Individual Step Status**: `pending`, `in-progress`, `complete`, `needs-analyze`, `blocked`
- **Step Dependencies**: Ensure logical user experience progression
- **Completion Dates**: Track when user experience steps are implemented
- **User Experience Validation**: Verify step implementation meets user experience requirements

### Status Management Protocol
- **Status Transitions**: Steps must progress through valid status transitions
- **Dependency Validation**: Blocked steps cannot complete until dependencies resolve
- **User Experience Testing**: Steps marked complete must have user experience validation
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time completion percentage updates for flows and milestones

### Integration with Milestones
- **Required Flows**: Milestones specify which user flows must be complete
- **Validation Gates**: Milestone completion blocked until all required flows reach specified status
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion tracking for milestone flow requirements
- **User Experience Validation**: Ensure user flows provide complete user experience before milestone completion

## 6.10 TODO Tracking Logic

**Directive**: Systematically track and manage TODO items and placeholders.

**Purpose**: The `/Placeholders/todos.jsonl` file collects all placeholder tasks, `TODO:` notes, and deferred scaffolding from AI-generated code

**Entry Requirements**:
- Each entry contains:
  - Timestamp
  - File and line reference
  - Reason for deferral or notes
  
**Capabilities**:
- This log enables MCP to:
  - Aggregate incomplete logic across the project
  - Propose task creation for unhandled `TODO` items
  - Review code quality and scaffolding completeness
  
**Integration**: These entries are optional and can be cross-referenced with `Tasks/` if any are formalized into proper subtasks

## 6.11 Completion Path Definition Process

### completionObjective Management

**Directive**: Define how completion objectives are initially defined and managed.

**Requirements**:
- Initially defined based on user requirements
- When and how they can be changed
- User approval process for modifications
- Documentation requirements for changes
- Version control and tracking

**Process**:
1. **Initial Definition**: Based on business requirements and user stories gathered during discovery phase
2. **Change Process**: Only with explicit user approval after reviewing impact on timeline and resources
3. **Change Steps**: 1. Propose change with rationale, 2. Review with stakeholders, 3. Update timeline/resources, 4. Document decision
4. **Version Control**: All changes tracked in projectlogic.jsonl with timestamp and reasoning
